# Session Summary: Story 1.11 Architectural Violations & Refactoring Plan

**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Session Focus:** Identify and document architectural violations in Story 1.11 implementation

---

## 🎯 Key Discoveries

### 1. **Story 1.11 Violated Bounded-Contexts Architecture**

**The Problem:**
Story 1.11 document (lines 332-334) stated:
> "UpdateUserUseCase (User Context) directly calls IEventRepository (Event Scheduling Context) for event rescheduling"
> "This is acceptable because rescheduling is synchronous business logic"

**The Truth (from bounded-contexts.md):**
- Lines 93-95: User Context publishes `UserUpdated`, `UserDeleted` events
- Lines 122-124: Event Scheduling subscribes to these events
- Line 97: User Context **"Dependencies: None (fully independent)"**
- Line 126: Event Scheduling **"Dependencies: None (reacts to domain events from User Context)"**

**Conclusion:** Story document **contradicted** the architecture and we followed the story instead of the architecture.

### 2. **Root Cause: Missing Architecture Docs in devLoadAlwaysFiles**

`bounded-contexts.md` was **NOT** in `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` → devLoadAlwaysFiles

This is why we didn't see the contradiction when implementing Story 1.11.

### 3. **Manual Schemas Instead of Prisma-Generated**

We manually defined `UpdateUserSchema`, `UserResponseSchema` in `schemas.ts` instead of deriving from Prisma-generated schemas at `src/domain/schemas/generated/schemas/models/User.schema.ts`.

---

## ✅ What We Fixed Today

### 1. **Updated devLoadAlwaysFiles Configuration**

**Commit:** `13b5409` - Add bounded-contexts.md and schema README to devLoadAlwaysFiles

Added to top of list (highest priority):
- `docs/architecture/bounded-contexts.md`
- `src/domain/schemas/README.md` (newly created)

**Impact:** Future dev sessions will load these critical constraints automatically.

### 2. **Created 3 Domain Events**

**Commit:** `832c6c1` - Fix Story 1.11: Use event-driven architecture per bounded-contexts.md

Created:
- `src/modules/user/domain/events/UserBirthdayChanged.ts`
- `src/modules/user/domain/events/UserTimezoneChanged.ts`
- `src/modules/user/domain/events/UserDeleted.ts`

Follows the pattern from `UserCreated` event in Story 1.10.

### 3. **Corrected Story 1.11 Document**

**Commit:** `832c6c1`

Updated sections:
- **Cross-Context Communication:** Now mandates domain events only
- **File Locations:** Added domain events and event handlers
- **Tasks 4-10:** Replaced direct dependency tasks with event-driven tasks

**Before:**
```
Task 3: UpdateUserUseCase constructor receives:
  - IUserRepository
  - IEventRepository (from Event Scheduling Context) ❌
  - TimezoneService (from Event Scheduling Context) ❌
  - EventHandlerRegistry (from Event Scheduling Context) ❌
```

**After:**
```
Task 3: UpdateUserUseCase constructor receives:
  - IUserRepository ✅
  - IDomainEventBus ✅
Note: Event handlers in Event Scheduling Context handle the actual rescheduling
```

### 4. **Created Refactoring Story (1.11b)**

**Commit:** `82095dd` - Add Story 1.11b: Refactor bounded context violations

Comprehensive refactoring checklist with 16 tasks:
- Create 3 event handlers (Event Scheduling context)
- Refactor 2 use cases (User context)
- Replace manual schemas with Prisma-generated
- Update all 210 tests
- Verify architecture compliance

**Estimated effort:** ~6.5 hours

---

## 📊 Current State

### Implementation Status

**Working Code:** ✅ All 210 tests passing (100% success rate)

**Architectural Compliance:** ❌ Violates bounded-contexts.md

**Specific Violations:**

1. `UpdateUserUseCase.ts` imports from Event Scheduling:
   - `IEventRepository`
   - `TimezoneService`
   - `EventHandlerRegistry`
   - `EventStatus`

2. `DeleteUserUseCase.ts` imports from Event Scheduling:
   - `IEventRepository`

3. Manual schema definitions instead of Prisma-generated

### What Works (Functionally Correct)

- ✅ GET /user/:id endpoint
- ✅ PUT /user/:id endpoint with event rescheduling
- ✅ DELETE /user/:id endpoint with cascade delete
- ✅ Birthday change triggers PENDING event rescheduling
- ✅ Timezone change recalculates UTC times
- ✅ COMPLETED/PROCESSING/FAILED events preserved (immutable)
- ✅ All unit tests passing (198/198)
- ✅ All integration tests passing (12/12)

### What Needs Fixing (Architectural)

- ❌ User context has direct dependencies on Event Scheduling
- ❌ Rescheduling logic lives in UpdateUserUseCase (User context) instead of Event Scheduling context
- ❌ Manual schema definitions violate DRY principle

---

## 📋 Next Steps (Story 1.11b)

### High Priority Tasks

1. **Create Event Handlers** (Event Scheduling Context)
   - `RescheduleEventsOnUserBirthdayChangedHandler`
   - `RescheduleEventsOnUserTimezoneChangedHandler`
   - `DeleteEventsOnUserDeletedHandler`

2. **Refactor Use Cases** (User Context)
   - Remove Event Scheduling dependencies
   - Add IDomainEventBus dependency
   - Publish events instead of direct rescheduling

3. **Schema Refactoring**
   - Derive UpdateUserSchema from Prisma UserSchema
   - Derive UserResponseSchema from Prisma UserSchema
   - Remove manual definitions

4. **Test Updates**
   - Update unit tests to mock IDomainEventBus
   - Update integration tests to register event handlers
   - Verify all 210+ tests pass

### Success Criteria

- ✅ User context has ZERO imports from Event Scheduling context
- ✅ TypeScript compilation verifies no cross-context coupling
- ✅ All 210+ tests passing
- ✅ Integration tests verify event-driven rescheduling works
- ✅ No performance degradation (handlers execute synchronously)

---

## 📝 Documentation Created

1. **src/domain/schemas/README.md**
   - Documents Prisma-generated schemas
   - Explains proper usage pattern
   - Provides examples for API DTOs

2. **docs/stories/1.11b.refactor-bounded-context-violations.story.md**
   - Complete refactoring checklist
   - 16 detailed tasks
   - Code examples and patterns
   - Estimated 6.5 hours effort

---

## 💡 Key Learnings

### 1. **Always Load Architecture Docs**

Critical docs must be in devLoadAlwaysFiles:
- ✅ `bounded-contexts.md` (now added)
- ✅ `coding-standards.md` (was already there)
- ✅ `design-patterns.md` (was already there)
- ✅ Schema README (now added)

### 2. **Story Can Be Wrong**

When story contradicts architecture:
- ✅ Architecture doc is authoritative
- ✅ Fix story first, then implement
- ✅ Document the correction in commit message

### 3. **Pre-Implementation Checklist**

Before coding ANY story:
- [ ] Read story file
- [ ] Load bounded-contexts.md - verify no cross-context dependencies
- [ ] Load coding-standards.md - verify schema/validation approach
- [ ] Check for generated code (Prisma schemas, etc.)
- [ ] Ask: "Am I importing from another bounded context?" → Use events!

### 4. **Bounded Context Rule**

**Simple test:**
```
If UpdateUserUseCase imports from src/modules/event-scheduling/
→ VIOLATION!
```

**Correct pattern:**
```
User Context → Publish Event → Event Bus → Event Scheduling Context
```

---

## 🔄 Refactoring Strategy

### Phase 1: Event Handlers (Event Scheduling)
Move rescheduling logic from UpdateUserUseCase to event handlers.

### Phase 2: Use Case Simplification (User)
Remove Event Scheduling dependencies, publish events.

### Phase 3: Schema Derivation
Replace manual schemas with Prisma-generated.

### Phase 4: Testing
Update all tests for event-driven architecture.
