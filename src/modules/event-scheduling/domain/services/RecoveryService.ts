/**
 * RecoveryService
 *
 * **Purpose:**
 * Detects missed events that should have executed during system downtime.
 * This service is invoked on system startup to identify backlogged events
 * that need to be processed.
 *
 * **Query Logic:**
 * Finds events where:
 * - `status = 'PENDING'` (not yet executed)
 * - `targetTimestampUTC < NOW()` (should have already fired)
 * - Ordered by `targetTimestampUTC ASC` (oldest first - fair recovery)
 * - Limited to 1000 events per batch (prevent memory overflow)
 *
 * **Why separate from ClaimReadyEventsUseCase?**
 * - Recovery service only DETECTS missed events
 * - ClaimReadyEventsUseCase actually CLAIMS and PROCESSES events
 * - Separation of concerns: detection â‰  execution
 * - Story 3.2 will handle batch processing via SQS
 *
 * **Logging:**
 * Uses Pino structured logging to report:
 * - Total count of missed events
 * - Timestamp of oldest missed event (how far behind system is)
 * - Timestamp of newest missed event (most recent backlog)
 *
 * @see Story 3.1: Recovery Service - Missed Event Detection

   * Detects missed events that should have executed during downtime

   * **Workflow:**
   * 1. Query repository for missed events (up to 1000)
   * 2. If no events found, log and return early
   * 3. If events found, calculate oldest/newest timestamps
   * 4. Log structured data about missed events
   * 5. Return RecoveryResult with statistics
   *
   * **Example Log Output (no events):**
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "level": "info",
   *   "msg": "No missed events found"
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * **Example Log Output (events found):**
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "level": "info",
   *   "msg": "Missed events found",
   *   "count": 42,
   *   "oldestEventTimestamp": "2025-10-19T14:00:00.000Z",
   *   "newestEventTimestamp": "2025-10-26T09:00:00.000Z"
   * }
   * ```
