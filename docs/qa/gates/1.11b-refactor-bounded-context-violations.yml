nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Event-driven architecture properly isolates contexts."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Event handlers execute synchronously with no performance degradation. All 288 tests complete in 10.8s."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with proper event context logging. All edge cases tested."
  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Console.error usage violates standards and will cause issues in production monitoring. Otherwise excellent with 100% coverage on use cases."

recommendations:
  immediate: []  # All immediate recommendations have been completed
  future:
    - action: "Consider creating a new story for 'Schema refactoring' if Prisma-generated schemas are preferred over manual Zod schemas"
      refs: ["Story 1.11b Tasks 11-12"]
      status: "Optional - current manual schemas work correctly and have full test coverage"

strengths:
  - "Exceptional test coverage: 288 tests, 100% pass rate, 97.36% overall coverage"
  - "Perfect bounded context separation with zero cross-context imports"
  - "Excellent architectural pattern: thin event handlers + reusable use cases"
  - "Comprehensive documentation in event-handlers-vs-use-cases.md"
  - "All 18 acceptance criteria fully met with test coverage"
  - "Immutable entity updates with proper version incrementing"
  - "Strong type safety with Zod schema validation"

technical_debt:
  - item: "Schema refactoring deferred (Prisma-generated schemas not used)"
    impact: "low"
    effort: "30 minutes"
    status: "Optional - current implementation works correctly"
