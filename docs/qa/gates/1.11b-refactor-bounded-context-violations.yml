# Quality Gate Decision for Story 1.11b
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "1.11b"
story_title: "Refactor Bounded Context Violations"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Implementation is architecturally sound with excellent test coverage, but contains coding standards violations (console.error usage and ESLint warnings) that should be addressed."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Event-driven architecture properly isolates contexts."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Event handlers execute synchronously with no performance degradation. All 288 tests complete in 10.8s."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with proper event context logging. All edge cases tested."
  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Console.error usage violates standards and will cause issues in production monitoring. Otherwise excellent with 100% coverage on use cases."

recommendations:
  immediate:
    - action: "Create Pino logger infrastructure (src/shared/logger.ts)"
      refs: ["docs/architecture/coding-standards.md"]
      effort: "30 minutes"
    - action: "Replace all console.error calls with logger.error"
      refs: ["6 event handler files"]
      effort: "15 minutes"
  future:
    - action: "Update ESLint config to allow PascalCase for Zod schemas"
      refs: [".eslintrc.js"]
      effort: "5 minutes"
    - action: "Consider creating a new story for 'Schema refactoring' (Tasks 11-12 were deferred)"
      refs: ["Story 1.11b Tasks 11-12"]

strengths:
  - "Exceptional test coverage: 288 tests, 100% pass rate, 97.36% overall coverage"
  - "Perfect bounded context separation with zero cross-context imports"
  - "Excellent architectural pattern: thin event handlers + reusable use cases"
  - "Comprehensive documentation in event-handlers-vs-use-cases.md"
  - "All 18 acceptance criteria fully met with test coverage"
  - "Immutable entity updates with proper version incrementing"
  - "Strong type safety with Zod schema validation"

technical_debt:
  - item: "Logging infrastructure incomplete (no Pino logger)"
    impact: "medium"
    effort: "45 minutes"
  - item: "Schema refactoring deferred (Prisma-generated schemas not used)"
    impact: "low"
    effort: "30 minutes"
