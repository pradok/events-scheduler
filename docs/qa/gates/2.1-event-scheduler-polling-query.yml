  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No security concerns. Port-based architecture prevents direct database access. Error logging excludes sensitive data.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Efficient implementation with hardcoded limit of 100 events. Atomic claiming prevents bottlenecks. Observability via structured logging includes duration metrics.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Error handling with rethrow preserves Lambda retry strategy. Atomic operations prevent data corruption. Optimistic locking provides additional safety.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent code documentation. Clean separation of concerns. AAA test pattern consistently applied. Self-documenting code with clear intent.'

    approach: 'Log and rethrow'
    compliance: 'EXCELLENT'
    notes: |
      - Structured error logging with context (message, stack)
      - Preserves error for Lambda retry strategy
      - Handles both Error objects and non-Error exceptions

  logging:
    library: 'Pino (structured logging)'

      - Start/completion logging with metrics (eventsClaimed, durationMs)
      - Error logging with full context
      - No console.log usage (ESLint enforced)

  typescript:
    strict_mode: true
