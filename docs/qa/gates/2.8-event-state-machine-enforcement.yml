reviewer_notes: |
  This is an exemplary verification story that demonstrates thorough quality engineering:

  1. SYSTEMATIC VERIFICATION: Dev agent methodically verified state machine implementation
     across all architectural layers (domain → repository → use case).

  2. COMPREHENSIVE TEST ADDITIONS: Identified and filled all coverage gaps with 14 new tests:
     - 11 unit tests covering all invalid state transitions
     - 3 integration tests for concurrent update scenarios
     - All tests use AAA pattern with descriptive names

  3. OUTSTANDING DOCUMENTATION: Added 168 lines to data-models.md including:
     - ASCII state diagram
     - Valid/invalid transitions tables with rationale
     - Optimistic locking mechanism with code examples
     - Error handling behavior
     - Lifecycle examples
     - Testing coverage section

  4. CORRECT ERROR HANDLING DESIGN: Dev agent correctly identified that OptimisticLockError
     should bubble up (not be caught) because it indicates another worker already processed
     the event. This shows deep understanding of distributed systems.

  5. REQUIREMENTS TRACEABILITY: Perfect mapping of all 8 acceptance criteria to specific tests.

  6. ZERO PRODUCTION CODE CHANGES: Validates that previous stories (1.3, 1.4, 1.6) implemented
     the state machine correctly. This verification story confirms quality.

  RECOMMENDATION: PASS with commendation. This story sets an excellent standard for
  verification stories in the project.
