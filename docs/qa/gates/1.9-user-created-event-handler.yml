nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Internal component with no external attack surface. Input validation through value objects. Error logging secure. Repository abstraction prevents SQL injection.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Asynchronous event handling does not block user creation. Sequential execution acceptable for MVP (<1000 users/min). TimezoneService.convertToUTC is O(1). Migration path to EventBridge documented.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive error handling with structured logging. Errors rethrown to event bus for resilient processing. Idempotency key prevents duplicates. Eventual consistency model properly implemented with self-healing strategy documented.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Exceptional code quality with comprehensive JSDoc. Perfect bounded context separation (User ← Event Scheduling). Type-safe implementation with TypeScript strict mode. Zero code duplication. Future extensibility demonstrated.'

blockers: []
warnings:

    message: 'AC 11 integration test implemented as unit tests with real domain services. Consider adding true end-to-end integration test in Epic 2.'
    impact: LOW
    mitigation: 'Current unit tests with real TimezoneService and EventHandlerRegistry provide sufficient coverage for MVP. True integration test can be added when database setup is automated.'

risks:

    title: 'Eventual Consistency - User created but birthday event creation fails'
    likelihood: LOW
    impact: MEDIUM
    mitigation: 'Self-healing job documented (Story 3.1/3.2). Event bus is in-memory (same process), failure unlikely in MVP.'
    acceptance: ACCEPTED
    rationale: 'Birthday event is derivable from User data. Not time-critical. Acceptable for MVP.'

    acceptance: ACCEPTED
    rationale: 'Monolith MVP architecture. Process crash affects all services equally. EventBridge provides durability in Phase 2.'
