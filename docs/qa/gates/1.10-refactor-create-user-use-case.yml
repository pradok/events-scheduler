# NFR Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Proper separation of concerns prevents unauthorized cross-context access."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Event publishing is async and non-blocking. No performance regressions introduced."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling. Event ordering ensures data consistency."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code clarity with comprehensive JSDoc. Reduced complexity from 128 to 115 lines."

# Architectural Assessment
architecture:
  bounded_context_compliance: EXCELLENT
  event_driven_pattern: EXEMPLARY
  dependency_direction: CORRECT
  separation_of_concerns: EXCELLENT
  notes: |
    This refactoring is a textbook example of proper bounded context architecture:
    - Zero cross-context dependencies (removed 3 Event Scheduling imports)
    - Clean event-driven communication pattern
    - Single Responsibility Principle perfectly applied
    - Future-proof for microservices migration

# Test Architecture Assessment
test_architecture:
  coverage_score: 100
  test_quality: EXCELLENT
  test_count: 7
  key_strengths:
    - "All 7 tests pass with comprehensive scenario coverage"
    - "Event ordering test ensures data consistency (publish AFTER persist)"
    - "Failure case test prevents event publishing when user creation fails"
    - "All validation error paths tested (timezone, dateOfBirth, Zod)"
    - "Clean AAA pattern with excellent readability"
    - "Proper mock isolation (2 dependencies instead of 4)"
  recommendations: []

# Code Quality Assessment
code_quality:
  adherence_to_standards: EXCELLENT
  complexity_reduction: true
  documentation: EXCELLENT
  notes: |
    Code improvements achieved:
    - Reduced from 128 to 115 lines (-10% simpler)
    - Constructor dependencies reduced from 4 to 2 (-50% coupling)
    - Comprehensive JSDoc documentation explaining architecture
    - Explicit accessibility modifiers throughout
    - TypeScript strict mode compliance
    - Zero ESLint warnings or errors
