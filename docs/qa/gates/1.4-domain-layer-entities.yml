nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'All input validation proper. No security vulnerabilities found. Safe error handling. SHA-256 for deterministic keys appropriate.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No performance concerns. Immutable objects thread-safe. Efficient state machine lookup (O(1)). No expensive operations in hot paths.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive error handling with custom domain error classes. State machine prevents invalid transitions. All edge cases tested.'
  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'Minor issues: Magic numbers hardcoded (100, 3, 9). Code duplication in name validation. ESLint naming warnings for schemas. All non-blocking.'
