# Project Brief: Time-Based Event Scheduling System

_Document Status: In Progress_
_Last Updated: 2025-10-18_

---

## Executive Summary

**Time-Based Event Scheduling System** is a distributed, timezone-aware event scheduling platform that triggers events at specific local times across multiple timezones. The platform starts with birthday messaging as its Phase 1 MVP while establishing the architectural foundation for any time-based event system.

**The Problem:** Organizations and applications need to execute time-sensitive actions (messages, notifications, API calls) at precise local times for users distributed globally. Existing solutions either lack timezone awareness, fail to guarantee exactly-once delivery, or cannot recover gracefully from system downtime without sending duplicates or missing events.

**The Solution:** A robust event scheduling system built on AWS serverless architecture that combines timezone-aware scheduling with exactly-once delivery guarantees and automatic failure recovery. Phase 1 delivers birthday messaging; the extensible architecture supports anniversaries, reminders, subscriptions, and any time-based event.

**Target Market:** Development teams building applications requiring time-based user engagement (SaaS platforms, consumer apps, notification systems) and organizations needing reliable timezone-aware scheduling without building complex infrastructure.

**Key Value Proposition:** "Set it and forget it" reliability - developers define events with local times, and the system handles timezone conversions, DST transitions, exactly-once delivery, and automatic recovery from failures.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current State and Pain Points

Modern applications serve globally distributed users who expect personalized, timely interactions in their local context. However, implementing reliable time-based event scheduling presents three critical challenges that existing solutions fail to address adequately:

**1. Timezone Complexity**
- Applications must trigger events at specific local times (e.g., "9:00 AM") across dozens of timezones
- Daylight Saving Time transitions occur on different dates in different regions
- Users may change timezones (travel, relocation) requiring schedule recalculation
- Converting between local time and UTC for storage/querying is error-prone without deep timezone expertise

**2. Exactly-Once Delivery Guarantee**
- Race conditions in distributed systems can cause duplicate message delivery
- Multiple scheduler instances may claim the same event simultaneously
- Retry logic after failures risks re-executing already-successful operations
- Clock skew between servers creates overlapping execution windows

**3. Failure Recovery Without Side Effects**
- When systems experience downtime, they must "catch up" on missed events
- Naive catch-up approaches either miss events entirely or send duplicates
- Distinguishing between "never sent" and "sent but status update failed" is difficult
- Manual intervention for recovery is unacceptable for production systems

### Impact of the Problem

**For Development Teams:**
- 40+ hours invested researching timezone libraries and DST edge cases
- Complex state machine logic required to prevent race conditions
- Extensive testing needed for time-based scenarios (leap years, DST transitions, etc.)
- Production incidents from missed or duplicate notifications damage user trust

**For End Users:**
- Receiving duplicate notifications frustrates users and degrades experience
- Missing important time-sensitive messages (renewals, reminders) causes real-world impact
- Messages arriving at wrong local times feel impersonal and poorly executed

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

**Cron-based Schedulers (AWS EventBridge Scheduled Rules, Kubernetes CronJobs):**
- No native timezone awareness (runs on UTC only)
- Requires manual timezone conversion and DST handling in application code
- No built-in exactly-once execution guarantees
- Difficult to handle user-specific schedules at scale

**Database TTL Mechanisms (DynamoDB TTL, Redis EXPIRE):**
- Imprecise timing (DynamoDB TTL: up to 48 hours variance)
- No "execute on expiry" hooks - requires polling
- Cannot guarantee exactly-once execution
- Limited control over execution order and priority

**DIY Polling Solutions:**
- Teams reinvent the same complex patterns repeatedly
- Testing time-based logic is difficult and often incomplete
- Edge cases (DST, leap years, concurrent updates) are discovered in production
- Maintenance burden grows as feature complexity increases

### Urgency and Importance

**Market Timing:** User expectations for personalized, timely engagement continue to rise. Applications without reliable time-based communication fall behind competitors who deliver seamless, timezone-aware experiences.

**Technical Debt:** Teams currently build fragile, custom solutions that accumulate technical debt. A robust, reusable platform prevents this proliferation while enabling rapid feature development.

**Scalability:** As applications grow globally, timezone complexity compounds. Solving this problem once, correctly, with a proven architecture is far more efficient than each team tackling it independently.

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept and Approach

The Time-Based Event Scheduling System provides a reliable, timezone-aware event scheduling platform that handles three critical capabilities:

1. **Timezone Intelligence** - Automatically converts local times to UTC, handles DST transitions, and ensures events trigger at the correct local time for users anywhere in the world
2. **Exactly-Once Delivery** - Guarantees no duplicate messages through atomic event claiming and idempotent execution
3. **Automatic Recovery** - Catches up on missed events after system downtime without manual intervention or sending duplicates

### How It Works (Simplified)

Users register with their birthday and timezone → System creates scheduled events → Events automatically trigger at 9:00 AM local time → Birthday message delivered via webhook → System generates next year's event

### Key Differentiators

**1. Timezone Intelligence Built-In**
- Handles all timezone conversions automatically
- DST transitions managed without manual intervention
- Events trigger at correct local time regardless of user location
- Example: User in New York and user in Tokyo both receive messages at their 9:00 AM

**2. Exactly-Once Delivery Guarantee**
- No duplicate messages under any failure scenario
- Atomic event claiming prevents race conditions
- Idempotent execution ensures retries don't cause duplicates
- State machine enforces valid event transitions

**3. Automatic Failure Recovery**
- System catches up on missed events after downtime
- No manual intervention required
- Failed events automatically retry with exponential backoff
- Dead letter queue captures permanently failed events for inspection

**4. Extensible Event Type System**
- Birthday messaging in Phase 1
- Architecture supports any time-based event type
- Add new event types without modifying core scheduling logic
- Event handlers are pluggable and configurable

**5. Developer-First Experience**
- Simple REST API for user management
- No timezone math required in application code
- Webhook delivery for easy integration
- "Set it and forget it" reliability

### Why This Solution Will Succeed

**Proven Approach:**
- Built on battle-tested distributed scheduling patterns
- Serverless architecture eliminates infrastructure management
- Database-backed state ensures reliability and recoverability

**Clear Value Proposition:**
- Solves complex timezone and reliability problems developers face repeatedly
- Reduces 40+ hours of research and implementation to a simple API integration
- Extensible architecture means future event types require minimal effort

**Focused MVP:**
- Birthday messaging is a well-understood, relatable use case
- Proves all core capabilities (timezone handling, exactly-once delivery, recovery)
- Establishes foundation for broader event platform vision

### Automatic Recovery: A Core Capability

One of the most critical differentiators of this system is **automatic, self-healing recovery** after downtime.

**The Challenge:**

When a scheduling system experiences downtime (server restart, deployment, infrastructure failure), it must catch up on all missed events without:

- Sending duplicate messages
- Missing any events
- Requiring manual intervention
- Losing data or state

**How This System Solves It:**

1. **Event State Tracking** - Every event has a status (`PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`) that survives system restarts

2. **Automatic Detection** - On startup, the system queries: "Which events are overdue but still PENDING?"

   ```sql
   Find events where:
   - targetTimestampUTC < NOW() (event time has passed)
   - status = 'PENDING' (never sent successfully)
   ```

3. **Self-Healing Execution** - All missed events are automatically queued and executed without any manual trigger or intervention

4. **Idempotency Protection** - Even if the system restarts multiple times during recovery, each event is delivered exactly once

**Example Scenario:**

- System goes down Monday at 2:00 AM
- 50 users have birthdays during the 24-hour outage
- System restarts Tuesday at 2:00 AM
- Recovery service automatically finds all 50 missed events
- All birthday messages are sent within minutes of restart
- No duplicates, no manual work, no lost messages

**Why This Matters:**

Most time-based systems require manual intervention after failures (running catch-up scripts, manually triggering missed jobs, fixing database states). This system is designed to "heal itself" automatically, making it production-ready and operationally simple.

### Product Vision

**Phase 1 (MVP):** Birthday messaging system proving timezone-aware scheduling, exactly-once delivery, and automatic failure recovery with webhook delivery.

**Phase 2+:** Multi-event platform supporting anniversaries, reminders, subscriptions with multiple delivery channels (SMS, Email, Push) and advanced features.

**Long-term Vision:** The "Stripe for time-based events" - developers integrate via simple API, and all timezone complexity, reliability guarantees, and infrastructure management is handled by the platform.

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)

- **User Management API:** RESTful endpoints for user lifecycle management
  - `POST /user` - Create user with firstName, lastName, dateOfBirth (YYYY-MM-DD), timezone (IANA format)
  - `GET /user/:id` - Retrieve user details
  - `PUT /user/:id` - Update user details (including birthday/timezone changes)
  - `DELETE /user/:id` - Delete user and associated events
  - Validation: Valid date formats, valid IANA timezones, required fields

- **Automatic Birthday Event Generation:** System-managed event lifecycle
  - Create birthday event automatically when user is created
  - Calculate target time: 9:00 AM in user's local timezone converted to UTC
  - Generate next year's birthday event when current year executes
  - Update/cancel events when user birthday or timezone changes (PUT endpoint)

- **Timezone-Aware Scheduling:** Precise local time execution
  - Store all timestamps in UTC for database consistency
  - Convert local time (9:00 AM) to UTC using Luxon with IANA timezone database
  - Handle Daylight Saving Time transitions automatically
  - Support all major timezones (tested with New York, London, Tokyo, Sydney)

- **Event Scheduler (Background Process):** Periodic event evaluation
  - Run every 1 minute via EventBridge trigger
  - Query: `SELECT * FROM events WHERE targetTimestampUTC <= NOW() AND status = 'PENDING' FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`
  - Atomic event claiming prevents race conditions between scheduler instances
  - Send event details to SQS queue for asynchronous processing

- **Event Executor (Worker Lambda):** Reliable event execution
  - Consume events from SQS queue
  - Execute webhook POST to RequestBin (or similar service)
  - Message format: `{"message": "Hey, {firstName} {lastName} it's your birthday"}`
  - Retry logic: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
  - Update event status: `PENDING → PROCESSING → COMPLETED` or `FAILED`

- **Exactly-Once Delivery Guarantee:** No duplicate messages
  - Optimistic locking with version numbers on events
  - State machine enforcement (only valid transitions allowed)
  - Idempotency keys for external webhook calls
  - Database transactions ensure atomic status updates

- **Automatic Failure Recovery:** Self-healing catch-up after downtime
  - **Automatic Detection:** On system startup, automatically query for overdue events that were never sent
  - **Query Logic:** Find events where `targetTimestampUTC < NOW()` AND `status = 'PENDING'`
  - **Self-Healing Execution:** All missed events automatically queued and executed without manual intervention
  - **Observability:** Late execution flag added to logs for tracking recovery operations
  - **Idempotency Guarantee:** Same idempotency protections prevent duplicates during recovery
  - **Dead Letter Queue:** Events failing after max retries captured for inspection
  - **Zero Manual Intervention:** System heals itself automatically on every restart

### Recovery Requirements (Critical)

Given that automatic recovery is a core differentiator and key requirement, these specific capabilities must be implemented:

#### R1: State Persistence Across Restarts

- Event status must be persisted in database and survive system restarts
- Status values: `PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`
- Status transitions must follow valid state machine rules

#### R2: Automatic Missed Event Detection

- System must automatically detect missed events on startup without manual trigger
- Detection query: Events where target time has passed but status is still `PENDING`
- No configuration or manual intervention required to enable recovery

#### R3: Duplicate Prevention During Recovery

- Events must be delivered exactly once even if:
  - System restarts multiple times during recovery period
  - Multiple scheduler instances run concurrently during recovery
  - Recovery is triggered multiple times
- Same idempotency mechanisms used for normal execution apply to recovery

#### R4: Recovery Performance Requirements

- System must catch up on 100 missed events within 5 minutes of restart
- Recovery must not impact normal event processing (events due "now")
- Late events processed with same reliability guarantees as on-time events

#### R5: Observability During Recovery

- Late execution flag must be logged for all recovered events
- Logs must include: how late the event is, original target time, actual execution time
- Metrics must distinguish between on-time execution and recovery execution

#### R6: Edge Case Handling

The recovery mechanism must correctly handle:

- **Multiple Restarts:** If system restarts 3 times in 1 hour, each restart should detect remaining missed events (not re-send already sent ones)
- **Partial Failures:** If recovery starts sending 50 missed events but crashes after 20, the next restart should only send the remaining 30
- **Status Update Failures:** If message is sent successfully but status update fails, recovery should not re-send (idempotency key prevents duplicate)
- **Clock Skew:** Recovery should work correctly even if server clock is slightly off

#### R7: No Manual Intervention

- No admin action required to trigger recovery
- No scripts to run after downtime
- No database cleanup or state repair needed
- System must be fully operational immediately after restart

**Why These Requirements Matter:**

Recovery is not a "nice to have" feature—it's a core requirement that distinguishes this system from fragile alternatives. The original brief explicitly states: _"The system needs to be able to recover and send all unsent messages if the service was down for a period of time (say a day)."_

Without robust recovery, the system cannot be considered reliable or production-ready.

### Out of Scope for MVP

- **Additional Event Types:** Anniversary messages, custom reminders, subscription renewals (deferred to Phase 2)
- **Multiple Delivery Channels:** SMS via SNS, Email via SES (Phase 1 webhook only, architecture supports future expansion)
- **Custom Trigger Times:** User-specified time preferences (hardcoded to 9:00 AM for MVP)
- **Authentication/Authorization:** API keys, user authentication (local development only for Phase 1)
- **User Dashboard:** Web UI for managing users and viewing event history
- **Advanced Scheduling:** Event dependencies, conditional execution, priority queues
- **Multi-Tenancy:** Separate data per organization (single-tenant for MVP)
- **Production Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana, alerting (CloudWatch logs only for Phase 1)
- **Rate Limiting:** API throttling and abuse prevention
- **Leap Year Special Handling:** Feb 29 birthdays send on Mar 1 in non-leap years (documented behavior, not configurable)

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

**Budget:**

- Phase 1: Learning/portfolio project with no budget constraint for development time
- Infrastructure costs: Target <$50/month for development environment
- Phase 2+: Production costs to be evaluated based on usage patterns

**Timeline:**

- Phase 1 MVP: 4-week implementation plan
  1. Foundation and basic user management
  2. Core event scheduling and timezone logic
  3. Reliability features (exactly-once delivery, retries, recovery)
  4. Testing, documentation, and performance validation

**Resources:**

- Solo developer project for Phase 1
- No external dependencies or third-party teams
- Limited to personal development time

**Scope:**

- Must run locally for development (no production deployment required for Phase 1)
- English-only messages and documentation for Phase 1
- Focus on proving core concepts, not production scalability

### Key Assumptions

**Product Assumptions:**

- Birthday messaging is a compelling enough use case to validate the platform concept
- Hardcoded 9:00 AM trigger time is acceptable for MVP (user preferences deferred to Phase 2)
- Webhook delivery is sufficient for Phase 1 (SMS/Email deferred to future phases)
- Developers (target users) are comfortable with REST API integration
- The architecture will successfully generalize to other event types beyond birthdays

**Business Assumptions:**

- Learning and portfolio demonstration are primary Phase 1 goals
- No immediate revenue or customer acquisition targets
- Project will be open-source or used internally (licensing TBD)
- Future phases are contingent on Phase 1 success and validation

**Quality Assumptions:**

- 1-minute scheduling precision is acceptable for birthday messaging (events don't need second-level precision)
- 24-hour recovery window is acceptable for testing recovery mechanisms
- Basic logging is sufficient for Phase 1 observability
- Manual intervention for schema changes is acceptable during development

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

- **Timezone Complexity Underestimated:** Timezone and DST handling may have more edge cases than anticipated. _Impact: Incorrect message delivery times._ _Mitigation: Extensive testing across multiple timezones and DST transitions, design allows library/approach changes if needed._

- **Exactly-Once Delivery Harder Than Expected:** Guaranteeing no duplicates in distributed systems is notoriously difficult. _Impact: Duplicate messages damage user trust._ _Mitigation: Multiple safeguards planned (atomic claiming, optimistic locking, idempotency), comprehensive testing of failure scenarios._

- **Scope Creep:** Adding features beyond MVP scope extends timeline and delays learning. _Impact: Project never reaches "done" state._ _Mitigation: Strict adherence to MVP scope document, defer all Phase 2 features._

- **Limited Real-World Validation:** Development environment may not reveal production issues. _Impact: Architecture works locally but has issues at scale._ _Mitigation: Document known limitations, plan for production validation in Phase 2._

- **Birthday Use Case Too Simple:** Birthday messaging may not stress the system enough to reveal architectural weaknesses. _Impact: Architecture fails when extended to more complex event types._ _Mitigation: Design with extensibility in mind, document planned event types to validate architecture decisions._

### Open Questions

**Product & Scope:**

- **Deployment Target:** Will this ever be deployed to production, or remain a development/portfolio project?
- **Event History:** Should executed events be retained indefinitely for audit trail, or archived/deleted after N days to reduce storage?
- **Error Surfacing:** How should permanently failed events be surfaced to users/admins (logs only for Phase 1, or plan for admin UI in Phase 2)?
- **Success Definition:** What specific outcomes would make Phase 1 a "success" and justify moving to Phase 2?

**User Experience:**

- **Webhook Testing:** What webhook testing service should be recommended in documentation for users to test integration?
- **User Timezone Changes:** If a user changes timezone after event is scheduled, should we recalculate immediately or wait until next event?
- **Leap Year Birthdays:** Should Feb 29 birthdays send on Feb 28 or Mar 1 in non-leap years? (Default behavior needs to be documented)

**Future Phases:**

- **Licensing:** Will this be open-source (MIT, Apache) or proprietary?
- **Second Event Type:** Which event type should be Phase 2 priority to validate extensibility (anniversary, reminder, subscription renewal)?
- **Multi-Tenancy:** At what phase should multi-tenant support be added (if ever)?
