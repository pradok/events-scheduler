# Story 3.3: Recovery on System Startup (Simplified)

---

## Status

Approved

---

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** recovery to run automatically when the system starts,
**so that** no manual intervention is required after downtime.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Application startup hook calls RecoveryService.execute()
2. Startup hook logs: "Recovery check complete" or "No missed events found"
3. Startup hook handles errors gracefully (logs error, allows system to continue)
4. Docker Compose restart triggers recovery automatically
5. Integration test simulates downtime and restart, verifies recovery runs

---

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Create Startup Hook File** (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create file `src/startup/recovery-hook.ts`
  - [ ] Import RecoveryService, dependencies (EventRepository, SQSClient, Logger)
  - [ ] Export async function `runRecoveryOnStartup(): Promise<void>`
  - [ ] Instantiate RecoveryService with dependencies
  - [ ] Call `await recoveryService.execute()`

- [ ] **Task 2: Add Logging to Startup Hook** (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Log start: `logger.info('Running recovery check...')`
  - [ ] Call RecoveryService.execute()
  - [ ] Log result based on eventsQueued count:
    - If eventsQueued === 0: `logger.info('No missed events found')`
    - If eventsQueued > 0: `logger.info('Recovery check complete', { eventsQueued })`
  - [ ] Wrap in try-catch:
    ```typescript
    try {
      const result = await recoveryService.execute();
      // ... log success
    } catch (error) {
      logger.error('Recovery check failed', { error: error.message });
      // Do NOT throw - allow system to continue
    }
    ```

- [ ] **Task 3: Call Startup Hook from Main Entry Point** (AC: 1, 4)
  - [ ] Open `src/index.ts` (or equivalent main file)
  - [ ] Import `runRecoveryOnStartup` from `src/startup/recovery-hook.ts`
  - [ ] Call `await runRecoveryOnStartup()` before starting scheduler
  - [ ] Ensure hook runs on every application start
  - [ ] For Docker Compose: verify hook runs when container restarts

- [ ] **Task 4: Call Startup Hook from Lambda Scheduler** (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Open `src/adapters/primary/lambda/schedulerHandler.ts`
  - [ ] Add one-time recovery check on cold start:
    ```typescript
    let recoveryCheckComplete = false;

    export const handler = async (event) => {
      if (!recoveryCheckComplete) {
        await runRecoveryOnStartup();
        recoveryCheckComplete = true;
      }
      // ... existing scheduler logic
    };
    ```
  - [ ] This ensures recovery runs when Lambda cold starts

- [ ] **Task 5: Write Unit Tests for Startup Hook** (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create `src/startup/recovery-hook.test.ts`
  - [ ] Mock RecoveryService dependencies
  - [ ] Test: `should call RecoveryService.execute()`
    - Arrange: Mock recoveryService.execute()
    - Act: Call runRecoveryOnStartup()
    - Assert: recoveryService.execute() was called
  - [ ] Test: `should log 'No missed events found' when count is 0`
    - Arrange: Mock execute() to return eventsQueued: 0
    - Act: Call runRecoveryOnStartup()
    - Assert: logger.info called with "No missed events found"
  - [ ] Test: `should log 'Recovery check complete' when events queued`
    - Arrange: Mock execute() to return eventsQueued: 5
    - Assert: logger.info called with "Recovery check complete" and count
  - [ ] Test: `should handle errors gracefully without throwing`
    - Arrange: Mock execute() to throw error
    - Act: Call runRecoveryOnStartup()
    - Assert: Does NOT throw (no expect().rejects)
    - Assert: logger.error called with error message

- [ ] **Task 6: Write Integration Test for Startup Recovery** (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Create `tests/integration/recovery-on-startup.integration.test.ts`
  - [ ] Use real database (Testcontainers PostgreSQL)
  - [ ] Use real LocalStack SQS
  - [ ] Test: Simulate downtime and startup
    - Arrange: Create 3 events with targetTimestampUTC in past (missed events)
    - Arrange: Set all to status=PENDING
    - Act: Call runRecoveryOnStartup()
    - Assert: Verify 3 messages in SQS queue
    - Assert: Logs show "Recovery check complete: 3 events queued"
  - [ ] Test: Startup with no missed events
    - Arrange: No PENDING events in database
    - Act: Call runRecoveryOnStartup()
    - Assert: Logs show "No missed events found"
  - [ ] Clean up: Delete test events and purge queue in afterEach

- [ ] **Task 7: Verify Docker Compose Restart Behavior** (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Start Docker Compose: `npm run docker:start`
  - [ ] Check logs show: "Running recovery check..."
  - [ ] Restart containers: `docker-compose restart`
  - [ ] Verify recovery check runs again in logs
  - [ ] Document verification in Dev Notes section of story

## Dev Notes

### Important Context from Previous Stories

**Story 3.1 - Recovery Service Detection:**
- RecoveryService.execute() returns RecoveryResult with eventsQueued count
- Logs missed events found and queued

**Story 3.2 - Recovery Execution:**
- RecoveryService sends missed events to SQS
- Returns count of successfully queued events

**THIS STORY:** Adds automatic trigger on system startup

### Startup Hook Pattern

**File:** `src/startup/recovery-hook.ts`

```typescript
import { logger } from '@/shared/logger';
import { RecoveryService } from '@/application/use-cases/RecoveryService';
import { PrismaEventRepository } from '@/modules/event-scheduling/adapters/persistence/PrismaEventRepository';
import { SQSAdapter } from '@/adapters/secondary/messaging/SQSAdapter';
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { SQSClient } from '@aws-sdk/client-sqs';

export async function runRecoveryOnStartup(): Promise<void> {
  logger.info('Running recovery check...');

  try {
    // Initialize dependencies
    const prisma = new PrismaClient();
    const eventRepository = new PrismaEventRepository(prisma);

    const sqsClient = new SQSClient({
      endpoint: process.env.AWS_ENDPOINT_URL || 'http://localhost:4566',
      region: 'us-east-1',
      credentials: { accessKeyId: 'test', secretAccessKey: 'test' }
    });
    const sqsAdapter = new SQSAdapter(
      sqsClient,
      process.env.SQS_QUEUE_URL!,
      logger
    );

    // Run recovery
    const recoveryService = new RecoveryService(
      eventRepository,
      sqsAdapter,
      logger
    );

    const result = await recoveryService.execute();

    // Log result
    if (result.eventsQueued === 0) {
      logger.info('No missed events found');
    } else {
      logger.info('Recovery check complete', {
        eventsQueued: result.eventsQueued,
        eventsFailed: result.eventsFailed
      });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Recovery check failed', {
      error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error)
    });
    // Do NOT throw - allow system to continue starting
  }
}
```

### Integration with Main Entry Points

**Local Development (`src/index.ts`):**
```typescript
import { runRecoveryOnStartup } from './startup/recovery-hook';

async function main() {
  // Run recovery check on startup
  await runRecoveryOnStartup();

  // Start scheduler
  // ... existing scheduler startup code
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

**Lambda Scheduler (`src/adapters/primary/lambda/schedulerHandler.ts`):**
```typescript
import { runRecoveryOnStartup } from '@/startup/recovery-hook';

let recoveryCheckComplete = false;

export const handler = async (event: EventBridgeEvent) => {
  // Run recovery once on Lambda cold start
  if (!recoveryCheckComplete) {
    await runRecoveryOnStartup();
    recoveryCheckComplete = true;
  }

  // ... existing scheduler logic
};
```

### Error Handling Strategy

**CRITICAL: Never throw from startup hook**
- If recovery fails, log error and continue
- System should still start even if recovery fails
- Operator can manually trigger recovery if needed
- Prevents downtime from blocking startup

### Why This Works

**Docker Compose restart:**
- Container restart = process restart = `src/index.ts` runs
- Startup hook executes automatically

**Lambda cold start:**
- Lambda cold start = new container = handler runs for first time
- `recoveryCheckComplete` flag ensures recovery runs once per container lifecycle

**No manual intervention:**
- No cron jobs needed
- No manual scripts to run
- Just restart the system - recovery happens automatically

### File Locations

**Files to Create:**
- `src/startup/recovery-hook.ts` (NEW)
- `src/startup/recovery-hook.test.ts` (NEW)
- `tests/integration/recovery-on-startup.integration.test.ts` (NEW)

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/index.ts` (add startup hook call)
- `src/adapters/primary/lambda/schedulerHandler.ts` (add cold start recovery)

### Technology Stack

**Dependencies:**
- **Pino** - Logging (already configured)
- **Prisma** - Database client (already configured)
- **AWS SDK SQS** - Message queue (already configured)

**No new dependencies required!**
