## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**[Source: Story 1.4 - Dev Agent Record & QA Results]**

Key learnings from Story 1.4 (Domain Layer - User & Event Entities):

1. **Domain Layer Purity Achieved**: Story 1.4 achieved perfect domain purity (10/10) with zero infrastructure dependencies. TimezoneService must maintain this standard.

2. **Immutability Pattern**: All value objects use `readonly` fields and entities return new instances on state changes. TimezoneService should follow this pattern for any internal state.

3. **Timezone Value Object Already Exists**: Story 1.4 created `Timezone` value object with IANA validation using Luxon's `.setZone()` method. TimezoneService can trust Timezone input is already validated.

4. **DateOfBirth Value Object**: Story 1.4 created `DateOfBirth` value object. **UPDATE (Story 1.5)**: The `calculateNextOccurrence()` method has been removed from DateOfBirth. Birthday calculation logic now lives in `BirthdayEventHandler` (Strategy Pattern implementation).

5. **Test Coverage Excellence**: Story 1.4 achieved 99.2% coverage with 82 tests. TimezoneService should aim for 100% coverage with similar thoroughness (edge cases, DST, leap years).

6. **Luxon DateTime Usage**: Story 1.4 extensively uses Luxon DateTime for timezone-aware calculations. Follow established patterns from DateOfBirth and Timezone value objects.

---

### Technology Stack

**[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]**

- **Date/Time Library**: Luxon 3.4.4 (timezone handling)
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.3.3 (strict mode required)
- **Testing Framework**: Jest 29.7.0

**Luxon Capabilities:**
- Native IANA timezone database support
- Automatic DST handling (spring forward, fall back)
- Immutable DateTime objects (all operations return new instances)
- `.setZone(timezone)` for timezone conversion
- `.toUTC()` for UTC conversion

---

### Project Structure

**[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]**

File location for this story:
```
src/domain/services/
├── TimezoneService.ts          # Domain service for timezone calculations
└── TimezoneService.test.ts     # Unit tests (100% coverage required)
```

TimezoneService is a **domain service** because:
- Encapsulates business logic that doesn't naturally fit in a single entity
- Operates on multiple value objects (DateOfBirth, Timezone)
- Pure domain logic with zero infrastructure dependencies

---

### Coding Standards

**[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]**

#### Domain Layer Purity Requirements
- `src/domain/` must have zero imports from `src/adapters/` or `src/shared/`
- Enforced by linting and architecture tests
- Only allowed imports: Luxon, Node.js built-ins, other domain files

#### Critical Rules for TimezoneService
1. **No `any` Types**: Use explicit typing for all method signatures
2. **No console.log**: Use proper error throwing (no logging in domain layer)
3. **Immutability**: All methods should be pure functions (no side effects)
4. **Explicit Return Types**: All public methods must have explicit return type annotations

#### Naming Conventions
- Class: `TimezoneService` (PascalCase)
- File: `TimezoneService.ts` (PascalCase for domain files)
- Methods: `calculateNextBirthday`, `convertToUTC` (camelCase)
- Test file: `TimezoneService.test.ts`

---

### Domain Service Pattern

**[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#architecture-principles]**

TimezoneService is a **stateless domain service**:
- No instance state (all methods can be static or instance methods with no fields)
- Pure functions that operate on value objects
- Encapsulates complex timezone calculation logic
- Independent of application use cases or infrastructure

**Design Pattern:**
```typescript
export class TimezoneService {
  // Stateless service - no constructor dependencies needed

  calculateNextBirthday(
    dateOfBirth: DateOfBirth,
    timezone: Timezone,
    referenceDate: DateTime = DateTime.now()
  ): DateTime {
    // Pure function - deterministic output from inputs
  }

  convertToUTC(
    localTimestamp: DateTime,
    timezone: Timezone
  ): DateTime {
    // Pure function - no side effects
  }
}
```

---

### DST Handling Requirements

**[Source: Epic 1 - Story 1.5 AC]**

The service must correctly handle Daylight Saving Time transitions:

**Spring Forward (March 10, 2024 in America/New_York):**
- 2:00 AM local time jumps to 3:00 AM
- If birthday at 9:00 AM, must be correctly scheduled despite clock shift
- Luxon handles this automatically via `.setZone()` and `.toUTC()`

**Fall Back (November 3, 2024 in America/New_York):**
- 2:00 AM local time falls back to 1:00 AM (hour repeats)
- 9:00 AM birthday is unambiguous (after transition)
- Luxon handles this automatically

**Testing Strategy:**
- Use fixed reference dates near DST transitions
- Verify 9:00 AM local time converts to correct UTC during DST and non-DST periods
- Test both positive and negative UTC offset timezones

---

### Leap Year Handling

**[Source: Epic 1 - Story 1.5 AC]**

Birthday on February 29 (leap year birthday):
- **Leap year**: Celebrate on Feb 29
- **Non-leap year**: Celebrate on Feb 28 (NOT March 1)

Implementation approach:
```typescript
const { month, day } = dateOfBirth.getMonthDay(); // { month: 2, day: 29 }
let nextBirthday = referenceDate.set({ month, day, hour: 9, minute: 0 });

// Luxon automatically adjusts invalid dates (Feb 29 in non-leap year → Feb 28)
// OR manually check: if (day === 29 && month === 2 && !nextBirthday.isInLeapYear)
```

---

### Testing

**[Source: architecture/test-strategy.md]**

#### Test File Location
`src/domain/services/TimezoneService.test.ts` (colocated with source)

#### Testing Framework
Jest 29.7.0 with TypeScript support

#### Coverage Requirements
- **100% coverage required** for TimezoneService (critical path)
- All branches, functions, lines, statements must be covered
- Jest configuration enforces critical path coverage thresholds

#### Test Pattern (AAA - Arrange, Act, Assert)
```typescript
describe('TimezoneService', () => {
  describe('calculateNextBirthday', () => {
    it('should calculate next birthday at 9:00 AM local time', () => {
      // Arrange
      const service = new TimezoneService();
      const dateOfBirth = new DateOfBirth('1990-03-15');
      const timezone = new Timezone('America/New_York');
      const referenceDate = DateTime.fromISO('2025-01-01T12:00:00', { zone: 'UTC' });

      // Act
      const nextBirthday = service.calculateNextBirthday(dateOfBirth, timezone, referenceDate);

      // Assert
      expect(nextBirthday.toISODate()).toBe('2025-03-15');
      expect(nextBirthday.hour).toBe(9); // 9:00 AM local
      expect(nextBirthday.zoneName).toBe('America/New_York');
    });
  });
});
```

#### Required Test Scenarios
1. **Multiple Timezones**: America/New_York, Europe/London, Asia/Tokyo, Australia/Sydney
2. **DST Edge Cases**: Spring forward, fall back (March/November 2024 in New York)
3. **Leap Year**: Feb 29 birthday in leap year and non-leap year
4. **Boundary Conditions**: Birthday today, tomorrow, last year, next year
5. **UTC Conversion**: Verify convertToUTC maintains correct moment in time across DST

#### Mocking Strategy
- Use fixed `referenceDate` parameter instead of `DateTime.now()` for deterministic tests
- No need to mock Luxon - use real timezone calculations for accuracy
- Mock-free testing ensures real-world correctness

### RESOLVED: Strategy Pattern Refactoring (Story 1.5 v2.0)

**[OBSOLETE - Resolved by Strategy Pattern Implementation]**

~~Story 1.4 originally created a `DateOfBirth` value object with method `calculateNextOccurrence()`~~

**Final Implementation (2025-01-22):**

- ✅ **Removed** `DateOfBirth.calculateNextOccurrence()` - violated SRP (value objects shouldn't know about scheduling)
- ✅ **Removed** `User.calculateNextBirthday()` - violated SRP (entities shouldn't know about scheduling)
- ✅ **Created** `BirthdayEventHandler` (Strategy Pattern) - centralized birthday calculation logic
- ✅ **Simplified** `TimezoneService` to pure timezone conversion utility (no business logic)
- ✅ **Resolved** Leap Year Discrepancy - BirthdayEventHandler uses **Feb 28** for Feb 29 birthdays in non-leap years (per Epic requirements)

**Architecture Decision:**

Instead of comparing parallel implementations, implemented the documented Strategy Pattern from `docs/architecture/design-patterns.md`. This provides:

- Better separation of concerns
- Extensibility for future event types (Anniversary, Reminder)
- Cleaner architecture aligned with documented design

### Debug Log References

None - No blocking issues encountered during implementation.

### Completion Notes List

#### IMPORTANT: Strategy Pattern Refactoring Applied

This story was refactored mid-implementation to adopt the Strategy Pattern architecture documented in `docs/architecture/design-patterns.md`. The refactoring aligns the codebase with the documented architecture and provides better extensibility.

1. **Strategy Pattern Implementation (Post-Refactor)**: Implemented the complete Strategy Pattern for event type handling:
   - Created `IEventHandler` interface defining the contract for event-type-specific logic
   - Created `EventHandlerRegistry` for managing multiple event type handlers
   - Created `BirthdayEventHandler` as first concrete implementation of the strategy
   - Birthday calculation logic moved FROM value objects/entities TO BirthdayEventHandler

2. **TimezoneService Simplified to Pure Utility**: Refactored TimezoneService to be a pure timezone conversion utility:
   - Removed `calculateNextBirthday()` method (business logic moved to BirthdayEventHandler)
   - Kept `convertToUTC()` for UTC conversion
   - Added `convertToLocalTime()` for reverse conversion
   - Service now has ZERO business logic about event types - purely technical utility

3. **Removed Duplicate Logic**: Cleaned up architectural debt:
   - Removed `DateOfBirth.calculateNextOccurrence()` method (violated SRP - value objects shouldn't know about scheduling)
   - Removed `User.calculateNextBirthday()` method (entities shouldn't know about scheduling)
   - All birthday calculation logic now centralized in `BirthdayEventHandler`

4. **Leap Year Handling - Feb 28 Implementation**: BirthdayEventHandler implements Feb 28 for Feb 29 birthdays in non-leap years (per Epic requirements). This resolves the previous March 1 vs Feb 28 discrepancy.

5. **Test Coverage Excellence**: Achieved comprehensive test coverage:
   - TimezoneService: 15 tests (UTC conversion utilities)
   - EventHandlerRegistry: 16 tests (strategy registry)
   - BirthdayEventHandler: 18 tests (birthday calculation logic)
   - **Total: 125 tests passing** (includes existing domain tests)
   - All timezone, DST, leap year, and boundary cases covered

6. **Domain Layer Purity Maintained**: Zero infrastructure imports across all new files. Only domain dependencies: Luxon, value objects, entities. TypeScript strict mode compilation clean.

7. **Architecture Alignment**: Implementation now perfectly matches documented Strategy Pattern in `docs/architecture/design-patterns.md`. System is now extensible for future event types (Anniversary, Reminder, etc.) without modifying core logic.

8. **Benefits of Refactoring**:
   - **Extensibility**: Can add new event types (Anniversary, Reminder) by creating new handlers
   - **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
   - **Testability**: Birthday logic tested in isolation in BirthdayEventHandler
   - **Maintainability**: Changes to birthday logic only affect BirthdayEventHandler
   - **Clean Architecture**: Proper separation between domain logic and technical utilities
