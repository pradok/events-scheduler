## Dev Notes

### LocalStack Desktop vs Web Console

**LocalStack Desktop (Free)**:
- Standalone application
- Connects to any LocalStack instance (Docker, local, remote)
- Works with Community Edition
- No account required (optional)
- Offline capable

**LocalStack Web Console (Pro)**:
- Browser-based
- Requires LocalStack Pro subscription
- Additional features (RDS, X-Ray, advanced metrics)

**Decision:** Use Desktop with Community Edition for MVP.

### Connection Configuration

LocalStack Desktop should automatically detect the Docker instance at `http://localhost:4566`. If not:

1. Open Settings/Preferences
2. Set endpoint: `http://localhost:4566`
3. Set region: `us-east-1`
4. Credentials: `test` / `test` (dummy credentials for local development)

### Resource Browser Expected State

After Story 4.1 completion, Desktop should show:

**SQS:**
- `bday-events-queue` (Main queue)
- `bday-events-dlq` (Dead letter queue)

**EventBridge:**
- `event-scheduler-rule` (Status: ENABLED, Schedule: rate(1 minute))

**IAM:**
- `lambda-execution-role` (Trust policy: Lambda service)

**CloudWatch Logs:**
- No log groups yet (will appear after Story 4.4 - Lambda deployment)

**Lambda:**
- No functions yet (will appear after Story 4.4)

### Testing Instructions

**Before starting:**
```bash
# Ensure LocalStack is running
npm run docker:start

# Verify resources exist
npm run docker:verify
```

**After Desktop setup:**
1. Connect Desktop to `http://localhost:4566`
2. Browse to SQS section → verify queues
3. Browse to EventBridge section → verify rule
4. Use Desktop to restart container
5. Verify resources persist after restart

### Troubleshooting

**Desktop can't connect:**
- Check Docker container is running: `docker ps | grep localstack`
- Check endpoint is correct: `http://localhost:4566` (not https)
- Check health endpoint: `curl http://localhost:4566/_localstack/health`

**Resources not showing:**
- Run verify script: `npm run docker:verify`
- Check init script ran: `npm run docker:logs | grep "initialization complete"`
- Try reconnecting Desktop

**Container management not working:**
- Desktop needs Docker socket access
- Check Docker Desktop is running
- Try restarting Desktop application
