# Story 1.8: Domain Event Bus Infrastructure

---

## Status

Done

---

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** an event bus abstraction for in-process domain event communication,
**so that** bounded contexts can communicate without direct dependencies.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. IDomainEventBus interface created in `src/shared/events/IDomainEventBus.ts`
2. Interface defines:
   - `publish<T extends DomainEvent>(event: T): Promise<void>`
   - `subscribe<T extends DomainEvent>(eventType: string, handler: (event: T) => Promise<void>): void`
3. Base DomainEvent interface created with common properties (eventType, context, occurredAt, aggregateId)
4. InMemoryEventBus implementation created in `src/shared/events/InMemoryEventBus.ts`
5. InMemoryEventBus stores handlers in Map<eventType, handler[]>
6. InMemoryEventBus executes handlers sequentially (preserves ordering)
7. InMemoryEventBus logs errors but continues processing other handlers (resilient)
8. Unit tests achieve 100% coverage for InMemoryEventBus
9. All code passes ESLint with 0 errors and strict TypeScript compilation

---

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Define IDomainEventBus interface** (AC: 1, 2)

## Dev Notes

This story implements the **Domain Event Bus** foundation for bounded context communication. It enables User Context and Event Scheduling Context to communicate via domain events without direct dependencies.

### Architecture Context

**[Source: architecture/bounded-contexts.md]**

This implementation belongs in:
- **Location:** `src/shared/events/`
- **Layer:** Shared infrastructure (cross-cutting concern)
- **Purpose:** Enable bounded contexts to publish/subscribe to domain events

**Why In-Memory Event Bus?**
- **Phase 1 (MVP):** In-process communication is fast (<1ms), simple to debug, and sufficient for monolith
- **Phase 2 (10K-100K users):** Swap to EventBridge for microservices (zero code changes in use cases)

---

### Design Pattern: Publish-Subscribe (Pub/Sub)

**Pattern Overview:**
- **Publishers** (User Context) publish domain events to event bus
- **Subscribers** (Event Scheduling Context) register handlers for specific event types
- **Event Bus** routes events to all registered handlers for that event type

**Key Benefits:**
- **Decoupling:** Publishers don't know about subscribers
- **Extensibility:** Add new subscribers without changing publishers
- **Testability:** Mock event bus in unit tests

---

### Implementation Strategy: Sequential Execution

**Why Sequential (not Parallel)?**

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG: Parallel execution (race conditions)
await Promise.all(handlers.map(handler => handler(event)));

// ✅ CORRECT: Sequential execution (predictable order)
for (const handler of handlers) {
  await handler(event);
}
```

**Rationale:**
1. **Predictable ordering:** Handlers execute in registration order
2. **Easier debugging:** Event handler failures are isolated
3. **Database consistency:** If multiple handlers update DB, sequential prevents conflicts
4. **Future-proof:** When migrating to EventBridge, ordering is preserved

**Performance Impact:**
- MVP: 2-3 handlers per event × 1-2ms = 3-6ms overhead (negligible)
- 10K users: Still negligible (in-process is fast)
- 100K users: Switch to EventBridge (async by default)

---

### Error Handling Strategy

**Philosophy: Resilient Event Processing**

```typescript
async publish<T extends DomainEvent>(event: T): Promise<void> {
  const handlers = this.handlers.get(event.eventType) || [];

  for (const handler of handlers) {
    try {
      await handler(event);
    } catch (error) {
      // ✅ Log error but CONTINUE processing other handlers
      console.error('Event handler failed', {
        eventType: event.eventType,
        aggregateId: event.aggregateId,
        error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error),
        stack: error instanceof Error ? error.stack : undefined
      });
      // DO NOT rethrow - continue to next handler
    }
  }
}
```

**Why Continue on Error?**
- If UserCreated handler #1 (create birthday event) fails, handler #2 (send welcome email) should still run
- Failed handlers can be retried by recovery job (self-healing)
- Prevents cascading failures

---

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Test Coverage Requirements:**

1. **Happy Path:**
   - Single handler receives event
   - Multiple handlers all receive same event
   - Handler receives correct event payload

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - No handlers registered (no-op, no error)
   - Multiple event types (isolated execution)
   - Handler throws error (other handlers still run)

3. **Ordering:**
   - Handlers execute sequentially
   - Registration order preserved

4. **Error Scenarios:**
   - Handler throws synchronous error
   - Handler rejects Promise (async error)
   - Error logged correctly

**Example Test:**

```typescript
describe('InMemoryEventBus', () => {
  it('should execute handlers sequentially (not parallel)', async () => {
    const eventBus = new InMemoryEventBus();
    const executionOrder: number[] = [];

    eventBus.subscribe('TestEvent', async () => {
      await delay(10);
      executionOrder.push(1);
    });

    eventBus.subscribe('TestEvent', async () => {
      await delay(5);
      executionOrder.push(2);
    });

    await eventBus.publish({
      eventType: 'TestEvent',
      context: 'test',
      occurredAt: DateTime.now().toISO(),
      aggregateId: 'test-123'
    });

    expect(executionOrder).toEqual([1, 2]); // NOT [2, 1]
  });
});
```

---

### Future Extensibility: EventBridge Adapter

**Phase 2 Migration (10K-100K users):**

```typescript
// src/adapters/secondary/messaging/EventBridgeEventBus.ts
class EventBridgeEventBus implements IDomainEventBus {
  constructor(private client: EventBridgeClient) {}

  async publish<T extends DomainEvent>(event: T): Promise<void> {
    await this.client.putEvents({
      Entries: [{
        Source: `bday.${event.context}`,
        DetailType: event.eventType,
        Detail: JSON.stringify(event),
        EventBusName: 'bday-event-bus'
      }]
    });
  }

  subscribe() {
    throw new Error('Use Lambda event sources for subscriptions');
  }
}
```

**Zero Code Changes in Use Cases:**
```typescript
// src/application/use-cases/user/CreateUserUseCase.ts
constructor(
  private readonly userRepository: IUserRepository,
  private readonly eventBus: IDomainEventBus  // ✅ Same interface
) {}

// Works with InMemoryEventBus OR EventBridgeEventBus
await this.eventBus.publish(userCreatedEvent);
```

- No authentication required (internal infrastructure)
- **Risk:** Low (internal system component)

**Performance:** ✅ PASS
- In-memory implementation (<1ms latency per handler)
- Sequential execution justified with performance analysis in Dev Notes
- Suitable for MVP scale (2-3 handlers × 1-2ms = 3-6ms overhead)
- Migration path documented for scale (EventBridge)
- **Risk:** Low (performance characteristics well-analyzed)

**Reliability:** ✅ PASS
- Resilient error handling (failures don't cascade)
- Rich error logging for debugging

### Security Review

**No security concerns identified.**

This is an internal infrastructure component with no external attack surface:
- ✅ No user input
- ✅ No network exposure
- ✅ No authentication/authorization needed
- ✅ Type-safe interfaces prevent injection

**Note:** Future handlers that process events WILL need security validation if they interact with external systems.

### Performance Considerations

**Performance Profile: EXCELLENT**

- **Latency:** <1ms per handler (in-memory, in-process)
- **Sequential Execution:** Justified with analysis (lines 162-185 in Dev Notes)
