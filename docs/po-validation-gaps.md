## Gap Analysis & Prioritization

### 🔴 PRIORITY 1: MUST FIX BEFORE DEVELOPMENT

#### Gap 1.1: Update User Reschedule Logic - Missing Detailed Specification

**Severity:** HIGH (Functional Requirement - Bonus Feature from Original Brief)
**Source:** Original Brief Bonus Requirement
**Current Status:** Acknowledged but not detailed

**Original Brief Requirement:**
> "For extra brownie points, add PUT /user for the user to edit their details. Make sure the birthday message will still be delivered on the correct day."

**Current Coverage:**
- Epic 1, Story 1.9, AC #4: "UpdateUserUseCase reschedules pending events when timezone/birthday changes"

**Problem:**
The acceptance criterion is too high-level. Critical questions unanswered:
1. When birthday changes (Feb 15 → Mar 20), what happens to existing PENDING event?
2. When timezone changes (EST → PST), how is targetTimestampUTC recalculated?
3. What if event status is PROCESSING or COMPLETED?
4. What if new birthday date has already passed this year?

**Impact if Not Fixed:**
- Developer ambiguity during Story 1.9 implementation
- Risk of incorrect implementation (e.g., duplicate events, missed reschedules)
- Failed acceptance testing due to unclear criteria

**Recommended Fix:**
Add detailed acceptance criteria to **Epic 1, Story 1.9**:

```markdown
**Additional Acceptance Criteria (Update User Event Rescheduling):**

11. When user birthday is updated (dateOfBirth field):
    - Query for PENDING events for this user with eventType='BIRTHDAY'
    - If PENDING event exists:
      - Update targetTimestampUTC to new birthday at 9:00 AM in user's current timezone
      - Update targetTimestampLocal field
      - Update dateOfBirth reference in event metadata
    - If new birthday date has already passed this year, set targetTimestamp for next year's birthday
    - Do NOT modify events with status PROCESSING, COMPLETED, or FAILED (these are historical)

12. When user timezone is updated (timezone field):
    - Query for PENDING events for this user
    - For each PENDING event:
      - Recalculate targetTimestampUTC to maintain same local time (9:00 AM) in new timezone
      - Update targetTimezone field to new timezone value
      - Keep targetTimestampLocal unchanged (still 9:00 AM local)
    - Do NOT modify events with status PROCESSING, COMPLETED, or FAILED

13. When both birthday AND timezone updated in single request:
    - Apply birthday update logic first (new date)
    - Then apply timezone update logic (new timezone for new date)
    - Ensure atomic transaction (both succeed or both fail)

14. Unit tests verify rescheduling logic:
    - Birthday changed before current year's event executes: event updated to new date
    - Birthday changed after current year's event passed: new event created for next year
    - Timezone changed: event time recalculated to maintain 9:00 AM local in new timezone
    - Both birthday and timezone changed: both updates applied atomically
    - Events in PROCESSING/COMPLETED/FAILED status are never modified
    - Edge case: Birthday changed to Feb 29 in non-leap year handled correctly

15. Integration tests verify database transactions:
    - User update and event reschedule succeed together or fail together
    - No orphaned events after failed user update
    - Concurrent user updates don't create duplicate events (optimistic locking)
```

**Effort:** 30 minutes (documentation update)
**Blocking:** No (can be fixed during Story 1.9 implementation, but better to fix now)
**Owner:** Product Owner (Sarah)

### 🟡 PRIORITY 2: SHOULD FIX FOR QUALITY

#### Gap 2.1: Webhook Test Endpoint Not Explicitly Configured

**Severity:** MEDIUM (Development Blocker Risk)
**Source:** PO Validation Section 3 (External Dependencies)
**Current Status:** Mentioned in Story 2.4 but not explicit

**Problem:**
Story 2.4 (Webhook Delivery Adapter) requires webhook testing but doesn't explicitly set up test endpoint.

**Current Story 2.4, AC #7:**
> "External webhook service (RequestBin) can be configured to respect idempotency keys"

**Issue:**
- "Can be configured" is passive - doesn't guarantee setup
- Developers may waste time searching for test endpoint
- Original brief specifically mentions "request bin endpoint (or a similar service)"

**Impact if Not Fixed:**
- Developer blocked during Story 2.4 testing waiting for endpoint setup
- Potential timeline delay (1-2 hours) while setting up RequestBin/webhook.site

**Recommended Fix:**
Update **Epic 2, Story 2.4**, replace AC #7 with:

```markdown
7. Test webhook endpoint configured for development and integration testing:
   - RequestBin (https://requestbin.com) or webhook.site endpoint created
   - Endpoint URL documented in .env.example as WEBHOOK_TEST_URL
   - Endpoint configured to log all requests with headers and body
   - Alternative: Local mock webhook server (optional for offline development)

8. External webhook endpoint configured to respect idempotency keys:
   - Webhook service logs show X-Idempotency-Key header in requests
   - Duplicate requests with same idempotency key can be identified in logs
   - Documentation explains how to verify idempotent behavior
```

**Effort:** 15 minutes (documentation + 5 min to create RequestBin endpoint)
**Blocking:** Medium (blocks Story 2.4 testing)
**Owner:** Product Owner (Sarah) + Developer (for actual endpoint creation)

---

#### Gap 2.2: Performance NFR Failure Contingency Not Defined

**Severity:** MEDIUM (Project Risk Management)
**Source:** PO Validation Section 8 (MVP Scope Alignment)
**Current Status:** Performance tests exist but no failure plan

**Problem:**
Story 4.4 (Performance Validation Tests) measures performance NFRs but doesn't define what happens if targets aren't met.

**Current Story 4.4:**
- Measures API response time (target: <200ms p95)
- Measures event processing throughput (target: 100/min)
- Measures recovery time (target: <5 min for 100 events)

**Missing:** What if we measure 350ms p95 instead of 200ms? Project blocked? Defer optimization?

**Impact if Not Fixed:**
- Unclear whether to block MVP release for performance issues
- Risk of scope creep (over-optimizing for MVP)
- No clear decision framework for performance vs. schedule trade-offs

**Recommended Fix:**
Add to **Epic 4, Story 4.4**:

```markdown
**Performance Validation & Contingency Planning:**

8. If performance tests meet or exceed all NFR targets:
   - Document actual performance metrics in README (e.g., "API p95: 145ms")
   - Mark Story 4.4 as complete
   - Proceed to MVP release

9. If performance tests fail to meet NFR targets:
   - Document actual vs. target metrics in performance test results
   - Analyze bottlenecks and identify root causes (database queries, serialization, etc.)
   - Create performance optimization tasks in backlog with severity labels:
     - CRITICAL: >50% variance from target (e.g., 300ms vs. 200ms target)
     - HIGH: 25-50% variance from target
     - MEDIUM: 10-25% variance from target
   - If all variances are MEDIUM or lower: Accept for MVP, defer optimization to Phase 2
   - If any variances are HIGH or CRITICAL: Product Owner decides go/no-go for MVP release

10. Performance optimization backlog items must include:
    - Current metric vs. target metric
    - Identified bottleneck (database, network, computation, etc.)
    - Proposed optimization approach
    - Estimated effort and risk level
```

**Effort:** 10 minutes (documentation update)
**Blocking:** No (decision framework, not immediate action)
**Owner:** Product Owner (Sarah)

#### Gap 2.3: Fastify AWS Lambda Adapter Not Explicitly Mentioned in Deployment Story

**Severity:** LOW (Documentation Clarity)
**Source:** PO Validation Section 6 (Architecture ↔ PRD Alignment)
**Current Status:** Architecture mentions `@fastify/aws-lambda` but no story sets it up

**Problem:**
- Architecture (deployment section) mentions: "Lambda: Wrapped in `@fastify/aws-lambda` adapter"
- Story 4.10 (Production Deployment Guide) doesn't explicitly mention configuring this adapter

**Impact if Not Fixed:**
- Minor developer confusion during Lambda deployment
- Potential missed step in deployment guide

**Recommended Fix:**
Add to **Epic 4, Story 4.10**:

```markdown
**Additional Acceptance Criteria:**

9. Deployment guide includes Fastify Lambda adapter configuration:
   - Installation: `npm install @fastify/aws-lambda`
   - Lambda handler wrapper example using `@fastify/aws-lambda`
   - Environment-specific configuration (local vs. Lambda)
   - Reference to AWS Lambda function handler setup
```

**Effort:** 5 minutes (documentation update)
**Blocking:** No (would be discovered during Story 4.10 anyway)
**Owner:** Product Owner (Sarah)

### 🟢 PRIORITY 3: CONSIDER FOR IMPROVEMENT (NON-CRITICAL)

#### Gap 3.1: Developer Onboarding Checklist Could Accelerate Ramp-Up

**Severity:** LOW (Developer Experience Enhancement)
**Source:** PO Validation Section 9 (Documentation & Handoff)
**Current Status:** Documentation comprehensive but scattered

**Problem:**
New developers must read:
- README (Story 1.1)
- Architecture docs (12 sharded files)
- API docs (Story 4.9)
- Deployment guide (Story 4.10)

No single "Quick Start" guide consolidating critical onboarding steps.

**Impact if Not Fixed:**
- Slower onboarding (1-2 hours reading multiple docs)
- Potential missed setup steps

**Recommended Enhancement:**
Create optional "Developer Quick Start" guide:

```markdown
# Developer Quick Start (15 Minutes)

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 20.11.0 LTS
- Docker 24.0.7
- Git

## Setup Steps
1. Clone repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Critical Requirements Validation

### ✅ All Critical Requirements from Original Brief Covered

| Critical Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|---------------------|--------|----------|
| 9AM Local Time Delivery | ✅ PASS | Epic 1 (Story 1.5), NFR6 |
| Recovery After Downtime | ✅✅✅ EXCEPTIONAL | **Entire Epic 3** (10 stories) |
| No Duplicate Messages | ✅ PASS | Idempotency, optimistic locking, Story 4.3 |
| Scalability (Thousands/Day) | ✅ PASS | NFR2 (144K/day capacity) |
| Extensibility for Future Events | ✅ PASS | Hexagonal Architecture |

**No critical requirements missed.**

### 📝 Key Assumption Documented

**Message Delivery Mechanism:**
- Original brief states: "send message via call to request bin endpoint (or a similar service)"
- **Assumption:** RequestBin is a webhook testing service → interpreted as **webhook/HTTP POST delivery**
- **Documented in PRD:** Phase 1 uses webhook delivery only (no SMS/Email)
- **Rationale:** Most flexible MVP approach, extensible to other channels in Phase 2+
- **Architecture supports:** Future delivery channels (SMS, Email, database write, etc.)
- **Epic Coverage:** Epic 2, Story 2.4 (Webhook Delivery Adapter)
