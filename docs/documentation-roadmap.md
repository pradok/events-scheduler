- [challenges.md](challenges.md) - 8 major technical challenge categories with deep analysis
- [brief-coverage-mapping.md](brief-coverage-mapping.md) - Traceability to original requirements

### ‚úÖ Architecture & Design
- [architecture-design.md](architecture-design.md) - Layered architecture, domain model, design patterns, data flows
- Component diagrams
- Separation of concerns
- Testing strategy (unit, integration, E2E)

### ‚úÖ Scope & Planning
- [phase1-mvp-scope.md](phase1-mvp-scope.md) - MVP scope, in/out of scope, success criteria, deliverables, implementation phases

---

## Potential Gaps (Non-Implementation Level)

### 1. ‚ùì Infrastructure Architecture
**What's Missing**:
- LocalStack-specific architecture decisions
- Database choice rationale (DynamoDB vs PostgreSQL)
- AWS service selection and why (Lambda vs ECS vs EC2 for scheduler)
- Networking/connectivity patterns

**Should we add?**: Yes, would be helpful for Phase 1 MVP

### 2. ‚ùì API Specification
**What's Missing**:
- API contract details (request/response schemas)
- Error codes and response formats
- API versioning strategy
- OpenAPI/Swagger spec outline

**Should we add?**: Yes, this is design-level, not implementation

### 3. ‚ùì Database Schema Design
**What's Missing**:
- Table designs (primary keys, secondary indexes)
- Query patterns mapped to access patterns
- Capacity planning considerations
- Migration strategy

**Should we add?**: Yes, schema design is architecture-level

### 4. ‚ùì Event Processing Semantics
**What's Missing**:
- Detailed state machine diagram with all transitions
- Timing diagrams for concurrent scenarios
- Sequence diagrams for race condition handling
- Transaction boundaries clearly defined

**Should we add?**: Partially covered, could be more visual

### 5. ‚ùì Observability & Monitoring Strategy
**What's Missing**:
- What metrics to track (beyond high-level mention)
- Log structure/schema
- Alert thresholds and SLOs
- Debugging playbooks for common scenarios

**Should we add?**: Yes, observability is design-level concern

### 6. ‚ùì Error Handling & Recovery Patterns
**What's Missing**:
- Error taxonomy (transient vs permanent)
- Retry policy details (backoff algorithm, max attempts)
- Circuit breaker thresholds
- Dead letter queue strategy
- Manual intervention procedures

**Should we add?**: Partially covered, could be more detailed

### 7. ‚ùì Security & Compliance Considerations
**What's Missing**:
- Data privacy (PII handling for user data)
- API security (authentication/authorization approach)
- Audit logging requirements
- Compliance considerations (GDPR for birthdays)

**Should we add?**: Yes, even for MVP we should document security posture

### 8. ‚ùì Deployment & Operations Strategy
**What's Missing**:
- Deployment model (how scheduler runs - Lambda? Container?)
- Zero-downtime deployment approach
- Rollback strategy
- Configuration management
- Environment strategy (dev, staging, prod)

**Should we add?**: Yes, for Phase 1 MVP

### 9. ‚ùì Performance Budgets & SLAs
**What's Missing**:
- Detailed performance targets per component
- Latency budgets (API, scheduler, executor)
- Throughput requirements
- Resource utilization limits
- Load testing scenarios

**Should we add?**: Partially covered in MVP scope, could be more detailed

### 10. ‚ùì Extensibility Roadmap
**What's Missing**:
- How we'll add new event types (step-by-step)
- Migration strategy from Phase 1 to Phase 2
- Backward compatibility considerations
- Versioning strategy for events/handlers

**Should we add?**: Would be helpful for understanding the evolution

## Priority Assessment

### üî¥ High Priority (Should Add for Completeness)

1. **Infrastructure Architecture with LocalStack**
   - Essential for Phase 1 MVP implementation
   - Clarifies deployment model
   - Documents LocalStack setup decisions

2. **Database Schema Design**
   - Critical for implementation
   - Documents indexes and query patterns
   - Enables capacity planning

3. **API Specification**
   - Contract for frontend/client integration
   - Enables parallel development
   - Documents error handling

4. **Security Considerations**
   - Even MVP needs basic security design
   - Documents PII handling
   - Sets foundation for future hardening

### üü° Medium Priority (Nice to Have)

5. **Detailed Error Handling Patterns**
   - Expands on what's in challenges.md
   - Documents retry policies explicitly
   - Defines DLQ strategy

6. **Observability Strategy**
   - Expands on what's in architecture-design.md
   - Documents metrics and logs structure
   - Defines alerting thresholds

7. **Deployment & Operations Strategy**
   - Documents how scheduler runs
   - Defines deployment process
   - Configuration management

### üü¢ Low Priority (Can Defer)

8. **Visual Diagrams**
   - State machine diagram
   - Sequence diagrams for race conditions
   - Timing diagrams

9. **Performance Budgets (Detailed)**
   - Phase 1 MVP has basic targets
   - Detailed profiling can come later

10. **Extensibility Roadmap**
   - Future phases already outlined
   - Detailed migration can wait until Phase 2

## Recommendations

### Essential Documents to Add

1. **infrastructure-design.md**
   - LocalStack setup and service choices
   - Deployment model (how scheduler runs)
   - Database choice and rationale
   - Environment configuration

2. **api-specification.md**
   - Request/response schemas for all endpoints
   - Error codes and responses
   - Validation rules
   - Example requests/responses

3. **database-schema.md**
   - Table designs with fields and types
   - Primary keys and indexes
   - Query patterns
   - Access patterns mapped to requirements

4. **security-design.md**
   - PII handling strategy
   - API security approach (even if "none for MVP")
   - Audit logging
   - Secrets management

5. **operational-guide.md**
   - How to deploy the system
   - How to monitor it
   - How to troubleshoot common issues
   - Runbooks for recovery scenarios

### Documents We Can Defer

- Detailed performance profiling documents
- Comprehensive sequence diagrams (can be in code comments)
- Phase 2+ migration guides

---

## Summary

### What We Have ‚úÖ
- Strong foundation: problem, challenges, architecture, patterns, scope
- Clear domain model and design patterns
- Component structure and data flows

### What We Should Add üî¥
1. Infrastructure design with LocalStack specifics
2. API specification (contracts)
3. Database schema design
4. Security considerations
5. Operational guide (deployment, monitoring, troubleshooting)

### What We Can Skip for Now üü¢
- Detailed sequence diagrams (can be inline in code)
- Performance profiling (beyond basic targets)
- Future phase migration details

## Next Steps

Would you like me to create any of the high-priority documents? I recommend starting with:

1. **infrastructure-design.md** - Clarifies how Phase 1 will be built with LocalStack
2. **database-schema.md** - Essential for implementation
3. **api-specification.md** - Defines the external contract
4. **security-design.md** - Documents security posture even for MVP
5. **operational-guide.md** - How to run, monitor, and troubleshoot

These would complete the design-level documentation before implementation begins.
