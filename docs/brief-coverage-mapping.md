**Coverage**:
- Core abstraction of timezone-aware event scheduling
- Multi-timezone coordination challenges
- DST handling
- Time evaluation strategies

### 5. Recovery from Downtime (Send Unsent Messages)
**Status**: âœ… Covered
**Location**: [challenges.md](challenges.md)
**Section**: Section 3: "Failure Recovery & Resilience"
**Coverage**:
- Downtime recovery without duplicates
- Catch-up scenarios (24-hour outage, brief outage during event window)
- Watermark tracking and resume strategies
- Partial failure handling

### 6. Database Technology Flexibility
**Status**: âœ… Implicitly covered
**Location**: [challenges.md](challenges.md)
**Section**: Section 4: "Database Performance"
**Coverage**: Discusses database patterns and considerations without prescribing specific technology. Notes on transactions, locking, indexing strategies that apply across databases.

### 7. AWS Stack / LocalStack / Serverless Offline
**Status**: Not covered (as requested)
**Reason**: Technology-specific implementation detail
**Will be covered in**: Architecture document with LocalStack-specific design

### 8. Third-Party Libraries (Express, Moment, ORM, etc.)
**Status**: Not covered
**Reason**: Implementation detail
**Will be covered in**: Tech stack decisions and dependency documentation

## "Things to Consider" Coverage

### 1. Scalability, Abstraction, Extensibility

**Status**: âœ… Covered extensively

**Locations**:
- [problem-statement.md](problem-statement.md)
  - "Key Insight" section - Decoupling of Event Definition, Scheduling, and Execution
  - "Success Criteria" - Abstract away birthday domain into general event system

- [challenges.md](challenges.md)
  - Section 6: "Extensibility & Maintainability"
  - Plugin architecture for event handlers
  - Strategy, Factory, and Registry patterns

**Coverage**:
- Core abstraction: Time-based events decoupled from domain (birthday, anniversary, etc.)
- Pluggable event handlers
- Configuration-driven event definitions
- Horizontal scaling strategies
- Queue-based architecture for load management

### 2. Code is Tested and Testable

**Status**: âœ… Covered

**Locations**:
- [problem-statement.md](problem-statement.md)
  - Success criteria: "Provide clear separation of concerns and high testability"

- [challenges.md](challenges.md)
  - Section 7: "Observability & Debugging"
  - Time travel testing utilities
  - Replay capability for failed events
  - Comprehensive logging strategies

**Coverage**:
- Separation of concerns enables unit testing
- Strategy pattern allows mocking event handlers
- Time-dependent testing approaches
- Observability for integration testing

### 3. Race Conditions & No Duplicate Messages

**Status**: âœ… Covered extensively

**Location**: [challenges.md](challenges.md)
**Section**: Section 2: "Exactly-Once Execution Guarantee" (entire section dedicated to this)

**Coverage**:
- Race condition scenarios identified:
  - Concurrent scheduler invocations
  - Retry logic duplicates
  - Clock skew issues
  - Downtime recovery duplicates
- Solutions discussed:
  - Idempotency keys
  - Atomic state transitions
  - Distributed locks
  - Version vectors
  - Deduplication windows

### 4. Scalability (Thousands of Birthdays per Day)

**Status**: âœ… Covered extensively

**Location**: [challenges.md](challenges.md)
**Section**: Section 4: "Scalability & Performance"

**Coverage**:
- Uneven load distribution challenges
- Peak time handling (multiple timezones hitting 9am)
- Burst processing for catch-up scenarios
- Horizontal scaling requirements
- Queue-based buffering
- Event batching strategies
- Database performance optimization
- Index design for time-based queries

---

## Bonus Feature Coverage

### PUT /user - Edit User Details with Correct Delivery

**Status**: âœ… Covered

**Location**: [challenges.md](challenges.md)
**Section**: Section 5: "Data Consistency & Concurrency" - "Entity Updates During Event Processing"

**Coverage**:
- Scenario 1: Birthday date change mid-processing
  - What if event already triggered?
  - What if event queued but not processed?

- Scenario 2: Timezone change
  - Impact on scheduled events
  - Next year's event implications

- Solutions discussed:
  - Event versioning
  - Immutable event instances
  - Cancel-and-reschedule strategy
  - Snapshot entity data into event payload

**Additional Coverage**:
- Optimistic locking for concurrent updates
- Race conditions on API operations

---

## What's NOT Covered (Intentionally)

The problem and challenge documents deliberately exclude:

### 1. Technology Choices
- Node.js runtime
- TypeScript language
- Express.js framework
- Moment.js / date libraries
- ORM selection
- AWS service selection

**Reason**: These are implementation details that should come after architectural design

### 2. API Design Specifics
- REST endpoint paths
- Request/response formats
- Validation rules
- Error response codes
- Authentication/authorization

**Reason**: Interface layer design comes in architecture phase

### 3. Database Schema
- Table structures
- Column definitions
- Relationships
- Indexes (discussed conceptually, not specifically)

**Reason**: Data modeling comes after architecture design

### 4. Infrastructure Details
- LocalStack configuration
- Docker setup
- Deployment pipelines
- Environment configuration

**Reason**: Will be covered in architecture and infrastructure documents

### 5. Code Organization
- Directory structure
- Module organization
- Naming conventions

**Reason**: Implementation detail for coding phase

## Summary

### âœ… Fully Covered
All core requirements and considerations from the brief are addressed at the conceptual and challenge level:
- Timezone-aware scheduling
- Recovery from downtime
- Exactly-once delivery (no duplicates)
- Scalability
- Extensibility and abstraction
- Race condition handling
- Entity update handling (bonus feature)

### ðŸ“‹ Intentionally Deferred
Implementation details that will be covered in subsequent documents:
- Technology stack specifications
- API design
- Database schema
- Infrastructure setup
- Code organization

### ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps
1. Create architecture document incorporating:
   - Component design
   - Data models
   - Technology choices (TypeScript, Node.js, LocalStack)
   - API specifications
   - Infrastructure setup

2. The architecture will reference these foundational documents to ensure all challenges are addressed in the design.
