# Requirements & Solutions Mapping

This directory maps each requirement from [brief.md](../brief.md) to its implemented solution.

---

## Purpose

For each requirement in the original brief, we document:

- **What** the requirement asks for
- **How** we solved it (architecture, patterns, technology)
- **Why** we chose this approach
- **Where** to find the implementation (code references)

---

## Requirements from Brief

## Document Status Legend

- âœ… **Documented** - Solution fully documented
- ðŸš§ **Phase 1** - Will be implemented in Phase 1 MVP
- ðŸš§ **Phase 2** - Planned for Phase 2
- ðŸš§ **To document** - Needs documentation

## How to Use This Directory

### For Developers

When implementing a feature, read the corresponding solution document to understand:

- Architecture decisions already made
- Patterns to follow
- Technology choices
- Code structure expectations

### For Reviewers

When reviewing code, check if implementation matches the documented solution approach.

### For Future Maintainers

Understand why things were built a certain way by reading the rationale in each solution document.
