## How to Resume Work

### If Starting a New Session

**Check Current Status:**
```bash
cat docs/bmad-workflow-status.md
```

**Understand BMad Workflow:**
```bash
cat .bmad-core/workflows/greenfield-fullstack.yaml
```

**Check What Exists:**
```bash
ls -la docs/
ls -la docs/architecture/
ls -la docs/prd/  # After PRD is sharded
```

### Agent Invocation Guide

**Claude Code (this IDE):**
- Invoke agents with: `@pm`, `@po`, `@sm`, `@dev`, `@qa`, `@architect`, `@analyst`
- Or use slash commands: `/pm`, `/po`, `/sm`, etc.

**What Each Agent Does:**
- **@pm** - Creates PRD with user stories and acceptance criteria
- **@po** - Validates documents, shards PRDs, ensures consistency
- **@sm** - Creates individual development stories from epics
- **@dev** - Implements stories with code
- **@qa** - Reviews implementations, suggests refactoring

## Key Documents Location

| Document | Path | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| Project Brief | `docs/brief.md` | Business requirements ("what" and "why") |
| Architecture | `docs/architecture.md` | Main architecture document |
| Architecture Shards | `docs/architecture/*.md` | 12 focused architecture modules |
| PRD | `docs/prd.md` | Product requirements with 40 user stories ‚úÖ |
| PRD Epics | `docs/prd/*.md` | Sharded epics (to be created by PO) |
| Stories | `docs/stories/*.md` | Individual dev stories (to be created by SM) |
