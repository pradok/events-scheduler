## How to Resume Work

### If Starting a New Session

**Check Current Status:**
```bash
cat docs/bmad-workflow-status.md
```

**Understand BMad Workflow:**
```bash
cat .bmad-core/workflows/greenfield-fullstack.yaml
```

**Check What Exists:**
```bash
ls -la docs/
ls -la docs/architecture/
ls -la docs/prd/  # After PRD is sharded
```

### Agent Invocation Guide

**Claude Code (this IDE):**
- Invoke agents with: `@pm`, `@po`, `@sm`, `@dev`, `@qa`, `@architect`, `@analyst`
- Or use slash commands: `/pm`, `/po`, `/sm`, etc.

**What Each Agent Does:**
- **@pm** - Creates PRD with user stories and acceptance criteria
- **@po** - Validates documents, shards PRDs, ensures consistency
- **@sm** - Creates individual development stories from epics
- **@dev** - Implements stories with code
- **@qa** - Reviews implementations, suggests refactoring
